README file for the meta-wandboard-ap layer

This layer turns the Wandboard Dual or Quad into a wireless access point.

Depends on:
- poky (Daisy or higher)
- meta-fsl-arm
- meta-fsl-arm-extra (Daisy or higher, 3.10.17 kernel)

Instructions:
- Clone this layer into sources subdirectory
- Add layer to BBLAYERS in build/conf/bblayers.conf:

Example:
BBLAYERS = " \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/poky/meta \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/poky/meta-yocto \
  \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
  \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-arm \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-arm-extra \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-demos \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-wandboard-ap \  <---- ADD LINE HERE
"

- Build a base or test image:

$ bitbake wandboard-ap-image-base

  -or-

$ bitbake wandboard-ap-image-test (adds some performance test utilities)

- The Wandboard should be visible with an essid of "wandboard".  The default
  passphrase is "wandboard"

NOTE: if you want to change these, then grep through the recipe files and
make modifications.

Performance Tests:
- Tested on Wandboard Dual and Quad using the iperf througput test with between
  17 and 21 Mbps throughput depending on the test.

TODO:
- Eliminate the need for special firmware to enable AP mode.  Ideally this
  would be part of the base linux-firmware package.
- Performance improvements.

NOTES:
- By default, this will cause the Wandboard to NOT work in STA (client) mode
  due to an incompatiblity between the firmware and the driver/kernel.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

Thanks to Scott Ellis (meta-pansenti) for the hostap-daemon-2.0 recipe.  This
was very helpful, and to CruX for blazing the path by showing how to set up
a working system.  And thanks to Otavio for general Yocto assistance.
